<h3> (2020) DroidCov: Android Test Automation Tool</h3>
<img src="/assets/img/2.jpg"></img>
<p>In this project we developed an automated way to test a set of Android apps using all the state-of-the-art Android testing tools
which are <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2931037.2931054">Sapienz</a> proposed in 2016,
<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1109/ICSE.2019.00042">Ape</a> proposed in 2019, 
and <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/test/monkey">Monkey</a> which is the most popular Android testing tool proposed by Google.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Used for <b>replication</b> of previous papers' experiments and testing a benchmark of around 30 Android apps automatically using all testing tools. Benchmark apps are selected from <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7372031">Choudhary et al paper</a>, and <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1109/ICSE.2019.00042">Ape paper</a>.</li>
<li>This tool can be used in a practical Android development context too, as it automatically can <b>test multiple versions of apps</b> using different testing tools simultaneously and collect <b>app failures and coverage results</b> for Android developers.</li>
<li> Studied the role of <b>randmocitiy</b> and <b>number of iterations</b> on the coverage achieved by proposed testing approaches. </li>
<ul>
