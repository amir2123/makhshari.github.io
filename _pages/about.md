I'm a second-year MASc. student at The University of British Columbia (UBC) and I will be graduated in August 2021.

  My overal research goal is to characterize developers' challenges, help them build bug-free and robust systems, and use Machine Learning to make their development more efficient. 

  I'm interested in analysis and characterization of **software bugs** in complex and distributed systems such as IoT, and developing ML-based techniques to detect bugs.
  My research interests are **Empirical Software Engineering**, **Software Bug Analysis**, Mining Software Repositories **(MSR)**, and Applying Machine Learning on Source Code **(ML4Code)**.
  My latest research work is related to characterization of **IoT Tests** in the wild which is not submitted yet.
  
  My recent research interest is the effect of **graph representation** of source code and **GNN models** in bug detection. 
  Also, I'm interested to investigate **ML4Code Trustworthiness**, such as explainability and robbustness of ML models when they used for Software Engineering tasks (specially generative tasks such as code completion).
