I'm a second-year MASc. student at the <a href="https://ece.ubc.ca/">Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) department</a>  at <a href="http://ubc.ca">UBC</a> and I will be graduated in August 2021. I've been a graduate Software Engineering (SE) Researcher at the <a href="https://people.ece.ubc.ca/amesbah/salt/"> Software Analysis and Testing (SALT) Lab</a>, advised by <a href="https://people.ece.ubc.ca/amesbah/">Ali Mesbah</a> from 2019. Previously, I've been an undergraduate SE reseacher under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=I_uJBz4AAAAJ&hl=en">Ahmad Barforoush</a>. Also, I've been a Software Engineering Teaching Assistant at <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/">UBC CS Department</a> for various courses such as Advanced Software Engineering, Software Engineering Projects, and Software Engineering Industry Skills.

My overal research goal is to characterize developers' challenges, help them build bug-free and robust systems, and use Machine Learning to make their development more efficient. I'm interested in analysis and characterization of **Bugs** in complex,cloud-based, and distributed systems such as **IoT**, and developing **ML-based** techniques to detect bugs. My research interests are **Empirical Software Engineering**, **Software Analysis**, Mining Software Repositories **(MSR)**, and Applying Machine Learning on Source Code (**ML4Code**).

[comment]: <> My latest research work is related to characterization of **IoT Tests** in the wild which is not submitted yet.
  My recent research interest is the effect of **graph representation** of source code and **GNN models** in bug detection. 
  Also, I'm interested to investigate **ML4Code Trustworthiness**, such as explainability and robbustness of ML models when they used for Software Engineering tasks (specially generative tasks such as code completion). )
