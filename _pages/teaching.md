  <h2>Research Experiences</h2>
  <ul>
        <li>Proposed a <b>bug taxonomy</b> for IoT with <b>Root Cause Analysis (RCA)</b> of more than 300 IoT bugs (<a href="https://conf.researchr.org/details/icse-2021/icse-2021-papers/67/IoT-Bugs-and-Development-Challenges">published in ICSE</a>).</li>
        <li>Systematically characterized the <b>development challenges</b> in IoT with <b>interviews and survey</b> with more than 200 IoT developers involved (<a href="https://conf.researchr.org/details/icse-2021/icse-2021-papers/67/IoT-Bugs-and-Development-Challenges">published in ICSE</a>).</li>
        <li>Provided an <b>IoT bug benchmark</b> consists of 323 labeled IoT bugs which is evaluated as <b>Reusable</b> by ICSE artifact evaluation committee (<a href="https://conf.researchr.org/details/icse-2021/icse-2021-Artifact-Evaluation/39/IoT-Bugs-and-Development-Challenges">published in ICSE Companion </a>).</li>
        <li>Conducted a large-scale automatic categorization of IoT-related <b>StackOverflow</b> discussions using Topic Modeling and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).</li>
        <li>Proposed an automatic <b>test case generation</b> technique for IoT systems, using <b>path coverage</b> of IoT SmartApps code. Experimented on <b>AWS</b> and <b>SmartThings</b> IoT platforms.</li>
        <li>Current Research: Systematically characterizing <b>IoT test suits</b> in different layers of IoT architecture (device, edge, cloud, app) and from different angels (tested components, test level and quality).</li>
  </ul>
